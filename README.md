---

## Try the CaptionBot yourself!

Check out yourself [here](https://share.streamlit.io/sankalp1999/image_captioning/main).
Some points while selecting images if you don't want (funny) predictions
1. Preferably, select from PC because for some reason, (on smartphone, it opens the camera or uploaded image is rotated). Try opening the application on Chrome if on 
smartphone.
2. You could select images like your profile pictures, dogs, anything which has some meaning in it etc. You can try
out multiple images once you have submitted one by just using "Browse File". 

3. Enjoy!

You can check some of the results below.
