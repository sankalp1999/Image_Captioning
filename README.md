# Caption Bot - Implementation of Show, Attend and Tell

README in progress. 

The model is up and working. Check out yourself [here].(https://share.streamlit.io/sankalp1999/image_captioning/main)
Some points while selecting images if you don't want (funny) predictions
1. Preferably, select from PC because for some reason, on mobile, it opens the camera.
2. You could select images like your profile pictures, dogs, anything which has some meaning in it etc. You can try
out multiple images once you have submitted one by just using "Browse Files"
3. Enjoy!

You can check some of the results below.
